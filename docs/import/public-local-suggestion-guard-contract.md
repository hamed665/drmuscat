# Public Local Suggestion Guard Contract

## Purpose

`src/server/public/import-local-suggestion-guard.ts` is the shared fail-closed runtime guard for local cross-family suggestions on imported public profiles.

It keeps local profile suggestions behind one public-safe boundary instead of duplicating the same rules in every profile guard.

## Supported families

The shared guard supports these normalized families:

- `doctor`
- `pharmacy`
- `hospital`
- `radiology`
- `dentistry`
- `beauty`

Accepted aliases must normalize to one of those families. Current aliases include plural forms plus `physician`, `imaging`, `diagnostic_imaging`, `dental`, `dentist`, `beauty_center`, and `beauty_salon`.

## Accepted payload locations

The guard may read suggestion rows from:

- `candidate_payload.relations.localSuggestions[]`
- `candidate_payload.relations.local_suggestions[]`
- `candidate_payload.relations.nearby[]`
- `candidate_payload.localSuggestions[]`
- `candidate_payload.local_suggestions[]`
- `candidate_payload.nearby[]`

## Public-safe row requirements

A row is omitted unless all of these conditions pass:

- target family is supported;
- target name exists;
- source area exists;
- source governorate exists;
- target area exists;
- target governorate exists;
- source and target area match after normalization;
- source and target governorate match after normalization;
- `publicVisible` or `public_visible` is `true`;
- relation status is empty, `active`, or `approved`;
- confidence is `high` or `medium`;
- source evidence exists through `sourceName`, `sourceUrl`, or their snake_case equivalents;
- `lastCheckedAt`, `last_checked_at`, `lastVerifiedDate`, or `last_verified_date` exists;
- the row is not a self-link back to the same source profile.

## Output shape

The public output shape is intentionally small:

```ts
export type PublicImportLocalSuggestion = {
  family: PublicImportLocalSuggestionFamily;
  name: string;
  nameAr: string | null;
  slug: string | null;
  area: string;
  governorate: string;
  sourceName: string | null;
  sourceUrl: string | null;
  lastCheckedAt: string | null;
  confidence: "high" | "medium";
};
```

No ratings, reviews, bookings, insurance claims, provider dashboard links, schema claims, or commercial claims belong in this output.

## Current consumers

Current imported profile guards using this shared runtime boundary:

- `src/server/public/import-doctor-profile-guard.ts`
- `src/server/public/import-pharmacy-profile-guard.ts`
- `src/server/public/import-hospital-profile-guard.ts`

## Future profile guards

Future imported profile guards should use `buildPublicImportLocalSuggestions(...)` directly rather than reimplementing local suggestion rules.

A profile guard must pass:

- the full candidate payload;
- the source `geo` record;
- the source family;
- the current source slug;
- an explicit display limit, normally `12`.
