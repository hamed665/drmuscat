## 16. FIX08 — Header wrapping and top/search layout repair

### Layout regression found after cleanup

- Cleanup correctly removed lower homepage scope, but the visual top shell needed a final layout repair.
- Header navigation could wrap into multiple rows on laptop/desktop widths.
- The hero/search stack needed to be explicitly vertical so the smart search command center stays full-width and readable.

### Header wrapping fix

- Header CSS was tightened so desktop/laptop keeps Brand | nav links | actions in one glass-pill row.
- Nav and action groups use internal horizontal overflow instead of expanding the header into multiple rows.
- Disabled preview-safe items remain compact and no new routes or auth pages were added.

### Hero/search vertical layout fix

- `HomePage2026HeaderHero` now renders compact hero intro first, the approved smart search full-width below it, then the minimal safety strip.
- The decorative side visual was removed from the rendered top shell so the search is no longer squeezed by a two-column hero layout.

### Smart search preserved

- No smart search state/autocomplete logic was rewritten.
- Controlled input, one-character suggestions, Arabic matching, suggestion grouping, hover/focus preview, click-to-fill, popular More handling and city/area dependency remain intact.

### Arabic/RTL status

- Header and top shell remain RTL-safe.
- Arabic title sizing remains compact.
- Arabic language switch continues to show `English`.

### Validation results

- `git status --short` — run during FIX08.
- `pnpm lint` — passed with existing repository warnings and no errors.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed.
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- Built-page HTML checks for `/en/om` and `/ar/om` confirmed top shell/search render and deferred lower-section markers remain absent.

### Forbidden files untouched

No database, Supabase, RLS, API, auth, payment, sitemap, robots, llms, package, lockfile, route helper, i18n config, route-check, migration, footer, route page or lower homepage section files were changed in FIX08.

## 17. FIX09 — Restore search-first top layout

### Regression reason

- The previous layout repair still allowed the marketing hero to dominate the first viewport.
- Search was pushed down by a large centered headline, making the page feel less search-first and less like the approved command center presentation.

### Oversized hero removed

- The rendered oversized hero block was removed from the current top shell.
- The search component's compact badge/title/subtitle now acts as the search-first intro for this scoped PR.

### Search-first layout restored

- The top shell now renders the approved full-width `HomeSearch2026` command center first, followed by the compact safety strip.
- Search is not placed beside hero text and is not squeezed into a two-column grid.

### Approved smart search preserved

- `HomeSearch2026` state, autocomplete, one-character matching, Arabic normalization, suggestion grouping, hover/focus preview, click-to-fill behavior, popular More handling and city/area dependency were not changed.

### Header balance status

- Header CSS was tightened again for desktop/laptop balance.
- Brand, nav and actions remain in one glass-pill row with internal overflow available for tight widths.

### Arabic/RTL status

- Arabic top layout remains search-first and compact.
- Arabic search intro uses smaller line-height-aware sizing.
- Language switch behavior remains unchanged.

### Validation results

- `git status --short` — run during FIX09.
- `pnpm lint` — passed with existing repository warnings and no errors.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed.
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- Built-page HTML checks for `/en/om` and `/ar/om` confirmed search renders before the safety strip and deferred lower-section markers remain absent.

### Forbidden areas untouched

No database, Supabase, RLS, API, auth, payment, sitemap, robots, llms, package, lockfile, route helper, i18n config, route-check, migration, footer, route page, lower homepage section file or search logic file was changed in FIX09.

## 18. FIX10 — Unified smart search card layout

### Problem fixed

- The approved smart search card visually read as split/two-column because the intro, command input, chips and location filters did not feel like one unified command center.
- Arabic felt busier because the intro and controls had too much competing horizontal structure.

### Unified vertical command-center layout

- The search card now uses a single vertical flow: compact badge/title/subtitle, full-width command input, content chips, provider chips, location row, popular suggestions and actions.
- The main input remains the strongest element inside the card and is not squeezed beside intro text.
- Suggestions are kept as a compact unified row/rail with the existing More behavior.

### Smart search behavior preserved

- `HomeSearch2026` search state, autocomplete, one-character matching, Arabic normalization, suggestion grouping, hover/focus preview, click-to-fill behavior, popular More handling and city/area dependency were not changed.

### City/area dependency preserved

- Country, city and area controls remain dependent and UI-only.
- Muscat, Sohar, Salalah, Seeb and Bawshar city-specific area behavior remains unchanged.
- Limited-data cities still fall back to `City-wide discovery` / `اكتشاف على مستوى المدينة`.

### Arabic/RTL status

- Arabic search intro uses the same vertical structure and avoids the previous split layout.
- Arabic title/subtitle remain compact and line-height-aware.
- Arabic autocomplete and chips remain RTL-safe.

### Validation results

- `git status --short` — run during FIX10.
- `pnpm lint` — passed with existing repository warnings and no errors.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed.
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- Built-page HTML checks for `/en/om` and `/ar/om` confirmed the search card renders, deferred lower-section markers remain absent and approved smart-search source markers remain present.

### Forbidden files untouched

No database, Supabase, RLS, API, auth, payment, sitemap, robots, llms, package, lockfile, route helper, i18n config, route-check, migration, footer, route page, lower homepage section file or search logic was changed in FIX10.

### Remaining deferred sections

Ads / Featured Board, Care Stories, Categories, Areas, Featured Doctors, Featured Centers, Offers, Articles, Provider CTA and Footer redesign remain deferred.

## 19. FIX11 — Responsive QA and final visual polish

### Responsive QA summary

- Reviewed the scoped top-shell/search/header files after FIX10 and kept PR #157 limited to the homepage top shell and approved Smart Search Command Center.
- Added CSS-only responsive polish for desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile widths without adding JavaScript layout code, dependencies or new routes.
- Kept deferred lower homepage sections out of this PR.

### Visual polish summary

- Refined the search surface with a warmer premium glass background, softer border, controlled teal/gold ambient accents and a stronger but still lightweight shadow.
- Improved the command input focus treatment so it remains the dominant homepage action without increasing card height.

### Header / brand polish summary

- Polished the existing `DM` + `DrMuscat` brand presentation through scoped header CSS only.
- Improved mark sizing, spacing, alignment and contrast while preserving the single official header and existing header links/actions.

### Search card, chips, location and suggestions polish

- Strengthened selected chip states with a clear teal gradient and softened unselected chip surfaces.
- Preserved compact horizontal chip rails and popular suggestion More behavior.
- Polished Country / City / Area select controls so they read as premium discovery controls rather than raw admin fields.
- Kept the secondary bottom search action visually quieter so the main command-row Search button remains dominant.

### Arabic / RTL status

- Arabic search remains in the same unified vertical layout.
- RTL legend styling avoids uppercase/letter-spacing treatments that would look unnatural in Arabic.
- Arabic chips, selects and suggestion rails keep the existing overflow-safe behavior.

### Smart search behavior preserved

- `HomeSearch2026` state, autocomplete, one-character matching, Arabic normalization, suggestion scoring/grouping, hover/focus preview, click-to-fill, popular More handling, search preview and city/area dependency were not changed in FIX11.

### Validation results

- `git status --short` — run during FIX11 and showed only the scoped doc/CSS changes before commit.
- `pnpm lint` — passed with existing repository warnings and no errors.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed.
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- Built-page HTML and source checks passed for `/en/om`, `/ar/om`, deferred lower-section absence and approved smart-search markers.

### Forbidden areas untouched

No database, Supabase, RLS, API, auth, payment, sitemap, robots, llms, package, lockfile, route helper, i18n config, route-check, migration, footer, route page, lower homepage section file or search logic was changed in FIX11.

### Remaining deferred sections

Ads / Featured Board, Care Stories, Categories, Areas, Featured Doctors, Featured Centers, Offers, Articles, Provider CTA and Footer redesign remain deferred.

### Merge-readiness recommendation

PR #157 is recommended to remain scoped as `UI-K-HOME-2026-A — Premium Homepage Top Shell + Smart Search`; future visual/product work should continue in `UI-K-HOME-2026-B — Featured Provider Board / Ads Board` or a dedicated header polish PR if a production logo asset is approved.

## 20. FIX12 — Language switch, mobile hamburger header and responsive safety

### Language switch status

- The header keeps the existing locale/country route structure and does not add new locales or routes.
- `/en/om` renders the language switch as `العربية` and points to `/ar/om`.
- `/ar/om` renders the language switch as `English` and points to `/en/om`.

### Mobile hamburger header status

- Narrow viewport header now shows the compact brand, the language switch and a real hamburger `<button>` instead of exposing the full desktop nav inline.
- The hamburger uses native popover behavior for a lightweight mobile menu, with no external library and no new dependency.
- The mobile menu contains the existing desktop destinations plus preview-safe pending/account items, reusing the same approved route helpers and disabled states.
- Desktop/laptop navigation remains visible and unchanged in behavior.

### Responsive safety status

- Mobile header CSS hides desktop nav links inline to prevent crowding and clipping.
- The mobile menu is constrained to the viewport, scrolls internally when needed and uses premium glass styling consistent with the top shell.
- Search component logic and approved search layout were not changed.

### Navigation translation deferred note

Full header navigation/i18n refinement remains deferred to a future header/navigation polish PR. FIX12 only guarantees the language-switch label/href correctness and mobile header safety required for PR #157.

### Validation results

- `git status --short` — run during FIX12 and showed only scoped header/CSS/report changes before commit.
- `pnpm lint` — passed with existing repository warnings and no errors.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed after adding native popover attributes.
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- Built-page HTML/source checks passed for `/en/om`, `/ar/om`, language switch labels/hrefs, mobile menu markers, deferred lower-section absence and approved smart-search markers.

### Merge-readiness recommendation

PR #157 remains recommended as `UI-K-HOME-2026-A — Premium Homepage Top Shell + Smart Search`. Lower homepage sections, footer redesign, full navigation/i18n polish and production logo work remain future PRs.

## 21. FIX13 — Hamburger icon polish and Arabic language switch hardening

### Arabic language switch fix

- Hardened `SiteHeader` locale detection by keeping the existing `x-drmuscat-locale` header and adding safe pathname-header fallbacks before defaulting to English.
- `/en/om` continues to render the language switch as `العربية` with `/ar/om` as the target.
- `/ar/om` now has a stronger server-side fallback path to render the language switch as `English` with `/en/om` as the target if the primary locale header is unavailable.
- No new locales, routes, route helpers or i18n config changes were added.

### Hamburger icon polish

- The existing mobile hamburger button behavior was preserved.
- The three strokes were made shorter, cleaner, centered and more compact with a dark teal color and softly rounded ends.
- No icon package, SVG asset or dependency was added.

### Validation results

- `git status --short` — run during FIX13 and showed only scoped header/CSS/report changes before commit.
- `pnpm lint` — passed with existing repository warnings and no errors.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed.
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- Built-page HTML/source checks passed for `/en/om`, `/ar/om`, language switch labels/hrefs, mobile menu markers, deferred lower-section absence and unchanged smart-search markers.

### Merge-readiness note

PR #157 remains scoped to `UI-K-HOME-2026-A — Premium Homepage Top Shell + Smart Search`; full navigation translation, production logo work and lower homepage sections remain future PRs.

## 22. FIX14 — Hard mobile menu close, hamburger icon and Arabic switch fix

### Arabic language switch fixed

- Kept the server-side `SiteHeader` locale resolution and added a tiny header-scoped browser sync as a hard fallback so `/ar/om` visibly resolves the language switch to `English` with `/en/om` as the target.
- `/en/om` continues to show `العربية` with `/ar/om` as the target.
- No new locale, route, route helper or i18n config was added.

### Mobile menu closes after nav click

- Mobile menu links and preview-safe menu items now carry a close marker.
- A small delegated header script calls the native popover `hidePopover()` when a marked mobile menu item is clicked, while preserving the link href navigation.
- Desktop navigation behavior is unchanged.

### Hamburger icon compacted

- The hamburger button now uses an explicit `dm2026-hamburger-icon` wrapper with three centered strokes.
- Stroke width, height and gap are constrained to compact premium dimensions and use the DrMuscat dark teal color.
- No external icon, SVG asset, dependency or image was added.

### Validation results

- `git status --short` — run during FIX14 and showed only scoped header/CSS/report changes before commit.
- `pnpm lint` — passed with existing repository warnings and no errors.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed.
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- Built-page HTML/source checks passed for `/en/om`, `/ar/om`, exact language switch labels/hrefs, mobile close markers, hamburger icon markers, deferred lower-section absence and unchanged smart-search markers.

### Manual QA results

- `/en/om` and `/ar/om` desktop/mobile language switch labels and hrefs were checked through built-page HTML/source validation.
- Mobile menu close behavior is implemented through the native popover close script and marked mobile menu items.
- Smart Search source markers remained unchanged.

### Forbidden files untouched

No database, Supabase, RLS, API, auth, payment, sitemap, robots, llms, package, lockfile, route helper, i18n config, route-check, migration, footer, route page, lower homepage section file or search logic was changed in FIX14.

### Merge-readiness note

PR #157 remains scoped to `UI-K-HOME-2026-A — Premium Homepage Top Shell + Smart Search`; remaining navigation/i18n polish and lower homepage sections should proceed in future PRs.

## 23. FIX15 — Locale source fix for header language switch

### Root cause found

- `RootLayout`, `AppShell` and `SiteHeader` all depend on request headers for the active locale.
- The existing Next.js request-interception file is `src/proxy.ts`, which is the project middleware-equivalent in this Next 16 app.
- The previous proxy parsed everything after the locale as a single `country` value, which made nested localized routes unreliable and did not expose `x-drmuscat-country`.
- The header then had to rely on brittle fallbacks and a browser-side language-sync patch.

### Locale source fix

- Updated `src/proxy.ts` to parse the first path segment as locale and the second path segment as country.
- `/en/om...` now forwards `x-drmuscat-locale: en` and `x-drmuscat-country: om`.
- `/ar/om...` now forwards `x-drmuscat-locale: ar` and `x-drmuscat-country: om`.
- The proxy does not redirect or rewrite URLs for this fix.

### Header cleanup

- Removed the browser-side language-switch text/href sync from `SiteHeader` because the language switch should now be correct on first server render.
- Kept the small mobile-menu close script so clicking a marked mobile menu item closes the native popover.
- Smart Search was not touched.

### Language switch QA result

- `/en/om` renders the language switch as `العربية` with `/ar/om` as the target.
- `/ar/om` renders the language switch as `English` with `/en/om` as the target.

### Validation result

- `git status --short` — run during FIX15 and showed only scoped proxy/header/report changes before commit.
- `pnpm lint` — run during FIX15.
- `pnpm typecheck` — run during FIX15.
- `pnpm build` — run during FIX15.
- `pnpm routes:check` — run during FIX15.
- Built-page HTML/source checks were run for `/en/om`, `/ar/om`, exact language switch labels/hrefs, mobile close markers, deferred lower-section absence and unchanged smart-search markers.

### Forbidden files untouched

No database, Supabase, RLS, API, auth, payment, sitemap, robots, llms, package, lockfile, route helper, i18n config, route-check, migration, footer, route page, lower homepage section file or search logic was changed in FIX15.

### Merge-readiness recommendation

PR #157 remains scoped to `UI-K-HOME-2026-A — Premium Homepage Top Shell + Smart Search`; the header locale source is now fixed at the request boundary and remaining navigation/i18n polish should continue in a future PR.

## 24. FIX15B — Root middleware locale header source

### Root cause found

- `RootLayout`, `AppShell` and `SiteHeader` depend on `x-drmuscat-locale` for the active global locale.
- There was no root `middleware.ts` or `src/middleware.ts` file setting this request header, while the header language switch depends on that value for correct first render.
- `/ar/om` could therefore still reach the global header as `en` when the request locale header was unavailable.

### Locale source fix

- Added root-level `middleware.ts` as the explicit locale header source requested for PR #157.
- The middleware parses pathname segments without redirecting, rewriting or changing URLs.
- `/en/om...` forwards `x-drmuscat-locale: en` and `x-drmuscat-country: om`.
- `/ar/om...` forwards `x-drmuscat-locale: ar` and `x-drmuscat-country: om`.
- No new locales, countries, route helpers, route config, sitemap or robots changes were added.

### Header status

- `SiteHeader` continues to derive the visible language switch from the resolved server locale.
- `/en/om` renders `العربية` targeting `/ar/om`.
- `/ar/om` renders `English` targeting `/en/om`.
- The accepted mobile menu close behavior and hamburger icon were not redesigned.

### Validation result

- `git status --short` showed only root `middleware.ts` and this completion report changed for FIX15B before commit.
- `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm build`, and `pnpm routes:check` passed during FIX15B.
- Built-page HTML/source checks for `/en/om` and `/ar/om` passed, confirming exact language switch labels/hrefs, mobile menu markers, Smart Search render marker, and absence of deferred lower-section markers.
- Forbidden-area checks passed and confirmed only this documentation file and root `middleware.ts` were changed in FIX15B.

### Forbidden files untouched

No database, Supabase, RLS, API, auth, payment, sitemap, robots, llms, package, lockfile, route helper, i18n config, route-check, migration, footer, route page, lower homepage section file or search logic was changed in FIX15B.

### Merge-readiness recommendation

PR #157 remains scoped to `UI-K-HOME-2026-A — Premium Homepage Top Shell + Smart Search`; root middleware now provides the request locale header required by the global layout/header.
