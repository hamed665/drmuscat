- Unsupported categories and footer planned items render as non-link previews/planned labels.

## 8. Accessibility/performance notes

- Sections use semantic `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, headings and real links.
- Unsupported/planned items are non-link text rather than dead links.
- Horizontal rails are CSS-only, keyboard-scrollable browser regions without carousel JavaScript.
- Touch targets use existing button/link sizing and pill spacing.
- No new dependencies, remote fonts, heavy JavaScript, animation libraries, large images or videos were added.
- Responsive grids collapse to two columns and one column for tablet/mobile.
- RTL-specific line-height and letter-spacing safeguards are included in CSS.

- `/en/om` built-page QA confirmed all new English section markers are present.
- `/ar/om` built-page QA confirmed Arabic localized section markers are present.
- Footer QA confirmed existing approved routes are links and unsupported/planned items, including About, Offers, Articles, Ads, Privacy, Terms and Contact, are non-links.
- Layout CSS review confirmed premium glass/card surfaces, horizontal rails, responsive card grids, lower-section separation and mobile breakpoints.
- Screenshot tooling remains unavailable in the container; no browser/screenshot dependency was added.
