# UI-K-HOME-2026-C Completion — Premium Discovery Categories with Motion Scenes

## 1. Final scope

Implemented the homepage-only, UI-only Discovery Categories section for PR #159 in `PHASED_BUILD_ONLY` mode. The section is static-safe, has no data fetching, and appears below the approved Smart Search top shell and Featured Provider Board.

## 2. Files changed

- `src/components/home/HomeDiscoveryCategories2026.tsx`
- `src/components/home/HomePage2026HeaderHero.tsx`
- `src/styles/dm2026-home.css`
- `docs/product/UI_K_HOME_2026_C_COMPLETION.md`

No optional route page edits were required.

## 3. Category list and hierarchy

The section includes exactly seven approved category cards:

1. Dental
2. Beauty & Aesthetics
3. Special Offers
4. Doctors
5. Labs
6. Pet Clinic
7. Hospitals

No extra Pharmacies, Services, Articles, Wellness, Centers, or additional category cards were added.

## 4. Large cards

Large / bold cards:

- Dental
- Beauty & Aesthetics
- Special Offers

These cards use the top bento hierarchy on desktop and remain first in mobile order.

## 5. Medium cards

Medium supporting cards:

- Doctors
- Labs
- Pet Clinic
- Hospitals

These cards are compact on desktop, become two-column on tablet, and single-column on mobile.

## 6. Motion scene strategy

All category visuals are CSS/SVG/HTML-only micro-scenes:

- Dental: glass tooth contour with subtle sparkle and float.
- Beauty & Aesthetics: face contour and serum droplet with soft shimmer.
- Special Offers: premium tag/seal with muted gold highlight and shine.
- Doctors: stethoscope/pulse cue with subtle stroke motion.
- Labs: vial/fluid/molecule cue with very soft movement.
- Pet Clinic: paw with medical cross and calm pulse cue.
- Hospitals: hospital building with cross and authority beacon cue.

No photos, stock images, external icons, icon libraries, canvas, Lottie, video, or animation dependencies were used.

## 7. Route/link safety

Only existing approved route helpers and slugs were used:

- Doctors links to the existing `doctors` discovery route.
- Labs links to the existing `labs` discovery route.

Cards without a safe approved category route render as non-link preview-safe articles. No routes were created and no dead links were added.

## 8. Arabic/RTL status

Arabic copy is included for the section heading, subtitle, card titles, card descriptions, and CTA pill. The component accepts `dir` and renders with natural RTL direction. Arabic typography uses the existing DrMuscat typography behavior and avoids negative letter-spacing.

## 9. Responsive behavior

- Desktop: 12-column premium bento layout with three large cards and four medium supporting cards.
- Tablet: 6-column layout; large cards remain prominent and supporting cards can sit two-column.
- Mobile: single-column order is Dental, Beauty & Aesthetics, Special Offers, Doctors, Labs, Pet Clinic, Hospitals.
- No horizontal overflow is intentionally introduced.

## 10. Accessibility notes

- Semantic `<section>` with an accessible heading.
- Decorative SVG scenes are `aria-hidden` and not focusable.
- Valid route cards are links.
- Non-route cards are semantic articles, not div-buttons.
- Focus-visible state is provided for linked cards.
- Text contrast uses established DrMuscat 2026 tokens and glass-card language.
- Motion respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## 11. Performance notes

- Static component only.
- No fetch calls.
- No Supabase calls.
- No API calls.
- No image assets.
- No video.
- No external requests.
- No new dependency or package changes.
- Motion is CSS-only and limited to subtle transform, opacity, and stroke-dashoffset effects.

## 12. SEO/route safety status

No SEO infrastructure was changed. No sitemap, robots, llms.txt, route-check scripts, route architecture, or i18n route files were edited. No new public route patterns were introduced.

## 13. Database/Supabase/RLS untouched confirmation

No database files, migrations, Supabase files, RLS policies, generated DB types, seed files, API routes, or backend code were edited.

## 14. Validation results

Required validation commands for this phase:

- `git status --short`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm routes:check`

Results after command execution:

- `git status --short`: completed before validation and after implementation review.
- `pnpm lint`: passed with existing repository warnings only.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `pnpm build`: passed.
- `pnpm routes:check`: passed.

## 15. Manual QA checklist

Manual QA targets:

- `/en/om` desktop
- `/ar/om` desktop
- `/en/om` laptop
- `/ar/om` laptop
- `/en/om` tablet
- `/ar/om` tablet
- `/en/om` mobile
- `/ar/om` mobile

Checklist status:

Visual browser screenshots could not be captured in this container because no Playwright/Chromium executable is available. Static HTML smoke checks confirmed `/en/om` and `/ar/om` render the new section copy. Full human visual QA should be completed in browser before merge.

Checklist:

- Smart Search still works.
- Featured Provider Board still works.
- Header language switch still works.
- Mobile hamburger still works.
- Category section appears below Featured Board.
- Dental, Beauty, Special Offers are visually larger/bolder.
- Doctors, Labs, Pet Clinic, Hospitals are medium cards.
- Special Offers says “Special Offers”, not just “Offers”.
- Motion is subtle and premium.
- Reduced motion is respected.
- No fake counts/ratings/availability.
- No new routes.
- No DB/API/Supabase/migration changes.
- No SEO infra changes.
- No package/lockfile changes.
- No horizontal overflow.
- Arabic typography is clean.
- Mobile layout is clean.

UI-K-HOME-2026-D — Provider CTA / List Your Center Section


## 17. Minimal embossed visual refinement

This refinement replaces the previous layered/animated graphic-card direction with the requested premium minimal embossed reference style while preserving the approved card grid, card structure, titles, descriptions, route-safe actions, and Explore pills.

### What changed

- Removed the rendered internal decorative scene stack from the cards and replaced it with one restrained embossed visual plate per card.
- Replaced the previous hero illustrations with minimal relief symbols: tooth, face/beauty contour, champagne diamond, medical care, lab vessel, veterinary paw/cross, and hospital facility.
- Rebuilt the discovery CSS block so the active card internals now use soft off-white/pearl/very-light-teal surfaces, subtle inner shadows, gentle outer shadows, and restrained DrMuscat teal accents.
- Kept Special Offers in the same minimal embossed style with only a subtle warm champagne accent.
- Reduced motion to minimal premium hover elevation and a tiny light sweep; no bouncing, rotating, playful, or cartoon motion remains in the active card internals.

### Scope confirmations

- The existing seven category cards remain in the same hierarchy.
- Card titles, descriptions, and Explore action text remain unchanged.
- The approved project font family was not changed or overridden.
- No header, Smart Search, Featured Provider Board, route, SEO infrastructure, i18n logic, backend, API, database, Supabase, RLS, migration, package, or lockfile files were changed.

### Validation results

Validation commands for this refinement:

- `git status --short`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`

Results after command execution:

- `git status --short`: completed and showed only the three allowed visual-refinement files modified before commit.
- `pnpm lint`: passed with existing repository warnings only.
- `pnpm typecheck`: passed.
- `pnpm build`: passed.
- Additional guardrail checks: `pnpm routes:check` and `git diff --check` also passed.

### Merge-readiness recommendation

Merge-readiness is recommended after automated validation passes and human desktop/mobile QA confirms `/en/om` and `/ar/om` show premium minimal embossed category cards matching the reference direction without changing the homepage architecture.
