# UI-K-HOME-2026-D — Premium Provider CTA / List Your Center Homepage Section

## 1. Final scope

Implemented a UI-only provider acquisition CTA section on the DrMuscat 2026 homepage immediately after the approved Discovery Categories section. The section is limited to homepage presentation and provider-oriented conversion messaging.

## 2. Files changed

- `src/components/home/HomeProviderCTA2026.tsx` — new localized provider CTA and static profile preview component.
- `src/components/home/HomePage2026HeaderHero.tsx` — mounted the provider CTA after Discovery Categories.
- `src/styles/dm2026-home.css` — added responsive DrMuscat 2026 glass/premium styles for the provider CTA.
- `docs/product/UI_K_HOME_2026_D_COMPLETION.md` — phase completion documentation.

## 3. UI-only provider CTA strategy

The section presents DrMuscat as a premium public discovery surface for healthcare providers in Oman. It uses calm commercial messaging, concise value points, and a profile preview card to communicate how a reviewed public profile can show photos, services, offers, and direct contact actions.

## 4. No form/backend/payment confirmation

This PR does not add a form, backend lead capture, API integration, CRM integration, Supabase calls, payment flow, checkout, pricing table, provider dashboard, or claim flow.

## 5. Media/photo preview approach

The profile preview includes a prominent but controlled CSS-only gallery/media placeholder. It uses gradients, soft glass overlays, and safe abstract visual blocks only. No external images, stock photos, real clinic photos, videos, or image assets were added.

## 6. Value points included

English value points:

- Premium profile
- Photos & gallery
- Special Offers
- WhatsApp, Call & Directions
- Arabic + English content
- Featured visibility preview

Arabic value points:

- ملف مميز
- الصور والمعرض
- العروض الخاصة
- واتساب واتصال واتجاهات
- محتوى عربي وإنجليزي
- معاينة الظهور المميز

## 7. CTA behavior and route safety

The CTA buttons use the existing approved localized provider route helper, `publicProviderRoute(locale, country)`, which maps to the existing `/[locale]/[country]/for-providers` route. No new route was created and no fake or dead links were introduced.

## 8. Arabic/RTL status

Arabic copy is included for headings, subtitles, value points, CTAs, preview labels, chips, rating preview, and notes. The component receives the existing `dir` prop and applies RTL-safe logical CSS properties.

## 9. Responsive notes

Desktop uses a premium two-column layout with content on one side and a profile/media preview on the other. Laptop and tablet widths stack cleanly when space is constrained. Mobile uses a single-column layout with full-width CTAs, compact media height, and no intentional horizontal overflow.

## 10. Accessibility notes

The section uses semantic `<section>` markup with an accessible heading reference. CTA actions are real links to an existing route. Preview-only action controls are disabled buttons to avoid fake submissions or dead behavior. Decorative glow/media elements are marked with `aria-hidden` where applicable, and focus-visible states are included for interactive links.

## 11. Performance notes

No new dependencies, external APIs, external images, videos, heavy JavaScript, or animation libraries were added. Visuals are CSS-only and reduced-motion preferences are respected for hover transitions.

## 12. SEO/route safety status

No SEO infrastructure files, sitemap, robots, `llms.txt`, route-check scripts, or i18n route definitions were changed. The homepage order is now Header, Smart Search, Featured Provider Board, Discovery Categories, Provider CTA, then stop.

## 13. Database/Supabase/RLS untouched confirmation

No migrations, seed files, Supabase clients, generated database types, RLS policies, API routes, database schema files, or backend data flows were changed.
