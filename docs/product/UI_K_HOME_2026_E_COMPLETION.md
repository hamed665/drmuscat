# UI-K-HOME-2026-E Completion — Premium Special Offers Showcase Carousel

## 1. Final scope

PR #162 adds a UI-only homepage Special Offers Showcase section for the DrMuscat 2026 homepage. The section is mounted after Discovery Categories and before the existing Provider CTA.

Scope is limited to:

- a new provider-led special offer showcase component;
- local static preview offer data only;
- lightweight client-side carousel state and timing;
- DrMuscat 2026 visual-system CSS for the section;
- homepage mounting only;
- this completion document.

No backend, database, route, Supabase, admin, API, form, payment, or real media work was added.

## 2. Files changed

- `src/components/home/HomeSpecialOffersShowcase2026.tsx`
- `src/components/home/HomePage2026HeaderHero.tsx`
- `src/styles/dm2026-home.css`
- `docs/product/UI_K_HOME_2026_E_COMPLETION.md`

## 3. Provider-led Special Offers strategy

The showcase uses provider-led preview cards rather than category-only tiles. Each card represents a safe mock offer from a preview provider or center, with provider name, provider type, area, city, offer title, category chips, media readiness, and confirmation microcopy.

The local preview dataset includes eight scalable offer items covering:

- Dental
- Beauty
- Labs
- Pet Clinic
- Medical Center / Center
- Doctors / Specialist
- Wellness / Nutrition
- Family care package

All provider names are preview-safe mock names and do not represent real approved providers.

## 4. Carousel/rotation behavior

The carousel uses lightweight React state. Desktop shows a three-card stage: previous, active, and next. The active center card is more elevated and visually stronger, while side cards remain visible and selectable.

Behavior:

- auto-rotates every 4.5 seconds;
- loops continuously through all eight preview offers;
- includes previous and next button controls;
- includes dot/progress controls for every offer;
- pauses while the section is hovered or focused;
- clears the interval on effect cleanup.

Mobile and tablet collapse to one active card per slide with the same controls and dots.

## 5. Image/video-ready media slot strategy

No real media, remote images, generated assets, or video files were added. Each preview item includes:

- `mediaType: image | video`;
- localized media label;
- accent category;
- media readiness indicator.

Video-ready cards show a refined glass play button and “Video-ready preview” language. Image-ready cards show a premium framed photo slot and “Photo-ready preview” language. No video playback or autoplay is implemented.

## 6. Future offers page readiness

The data shape and UI are ready for a future `/offers` planning phase, paid homepage placements, category offer placements, area offer placements, provider campaigns, and provider/admin uploaded offer media.

This PR intentionally does not create `/offers`, offer detail routes, backend offer records, admin upload flows, provider panel features, or SEO pages.

## 7. CTA behavior

The card CTAs are preview-safe `<button>` elements. They are styled as interactive UI controls but do not link to nonexistent offer routes and do not trigger backend behavior.

English labels:

- View offer
- View profile

Arabic labels:

- عرض التفاصيل
- عرض الملف

## 8. Content safety notes

The section avoids fake commercial or medical claims. It does not include:

- fake prices;
- fake discounts;
- fake percentages;
- fake urgency;
- fake availability;
- fake booking;
- fake ratings;
- fake review counts;
- best/top claims;
- guaranteed results;
- medical outcome claims.

Safe wording is limited to preview and review language such as provider-approved offer, public discovery only, photo-ready preview, video-ready preview, and confirm details with provider.

## 9. Arabic/RTL notes

The section includes localized Arabic copy for the section header, controls, CTAs, offer content, chips, media labels, and trust notes. RTL-specific CSS removes negative Latin-style letter spacing from Arabic headlines and card titles, keeps text aligned to logical start, and avoids clipped Arabic by using flexible wrapping and responsive sizing.

## 10. Responsive notes

Desktop uses a premium three-card carousel stage with a stronger center card. Tablet and mobile show one main active card. Mobile media remains prominent while content, chips, CTA buttons, dots, and trust notes remain visible without horizontal overflow.

## 11. Performance notes

The implementation uses no animation library, no new dependency, no real media assets, no video playback, and no remote requests. Motion is limited to CSS transforms/transitions and a single interval when reduced motion is not requested.

## 12. No backend/database/SEO changes confirmation

Confirmed not changed or added:

- database migrations;
- Supabase files;
- API routes;
- admin routes;
- backend logic;
- package files;
- sitemap files;
- robots files;
- `llms.txt`;
- generated database types;
- seed files;
- public route creation.

## 13. Validation results

- `git status --short`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
