# UI-K-HOME-2026-E Completion — Premium Special Offers Showcase Carousel

## 1. Final scope

PR #162 adds a UI-only homepage Special Offers Showcase section for the DrMuscat 2026 homepage. The section is mounted after Discovery Categories and before the existing Provider CTA.

Scope is limited to:

- a new provider-led special offer showcase component;
- local static preview offer data only;
- lightweight client-side carousel state and timing;
- DrMuscat 2026 visual-system CSS for the section;
- homepage mounting only;
- this completion document.

No backend, database, route, Supabase, admin, API, form, payment, or real media work was added.

## 2. Files changed

- `src/components/home/HomeSpecialOffersShowcase2026.tsx`
- `src/components/home/HomePage2026HeaderHero.tsx`
- `src/styles/dm2026-home.css`
- `docs/product/UI_K_HOME_2026_E_COMPLETION.md`

## 3. Provider-led Special Offers strategy

The showcase uses provider-led preview cards rather than category-only tiles. Each card represents a safe mock offer from a preview provider or center, with provider name, provider type, area, city, offer title, category chips, media readiness, and confirmation microcopy.

The local preview dataset includes eight scalable offer items covering:

- Dental
- Beauty
- Labs
- Pet Clinic
- Medical Center / Center
- Doctors / Specialist
- Wellness / Nutrition
- Family care package

All provider names are preview-safe mock names and do not represent real approved providers.

## 4. Carousel/rotation behavior

The carousel uses lightweight React state. Desktop shows a three-card stage: previous, active, and next. The active center card is more elevated and visually stronger, while side cards remain visible and selectable.

Behavior:

- auto-rotates every 4.5 seconds;
- loops continuously through all eight preview offers;
- includes previous and next button controls;
- includes dot/progress controls for every offer;
- pauses while the section is hovered or focused;
- clears the interval on effect cleanup.

Mobile and tablet collapse to one active card per slide with the same controls and dots.

## 5. Image/video-ready media slot strategy

No real media, remote images, generated assets, or video files were added. Each preview item includes:

- `mediaType: image | video`;
- localized media label;
- accent category;
- media readiness indicator.

Video-ready cards show a refined glass play button and “Video-ready preview” language. Image-ready cards show a premium framed photo slot and “Photo-ready preview” language. No video playback or autoplay is implemented.

## 6. Future offers page readiness

The data shape and UI are ready for a future `/offers` planning phase, paid homepage placements, category offer placements, area offer placements, provider campaigns, and provider/admin uploaded offer media.

This PR intentionally does not create `/offers`, offer detail routes, backend offer records, admin upload flows, provider panel features, or SEO pages.

## 7. CTA behavior

The card CTAs are preview-safe `<button>` elements. They are styled as interactive UI controls but do not link to nonexistent offer routes and do not trigger backend behavior.

English labels:

- View offer
- View profile

Arabic labels:

- عرض التفاصيل
- عرض الملف

## 8. Content safety notes

The section avoids fake commercial or medical claims. It does not include:

- fake prices;
- fake discounts;
- fake percentages;
- fake urgency;
- fake availability;
- fake booking;
- fake ratings;
- fake review counts;
- best/top claims;
- guaranteed results;
- medical outcome claims.

Safe wording is limited to preview and review language such as provider-approved offer, public discovery only, photo-ready preview, video-ready preview, and confirm details with provider.

## 9. Arabic/RTL notes

The section includes localized Arabic copy for the section header, controls, CTAs, offer content, chips, media labels, and trust notes. RTL-specific CSS removes negative Latin-style letter spacing from Arabic headlines and card titles, keeps text aligned to logical start, and avoids clipped Arabic by using flexible wrapping and responsive sizing.

## 10. Responsive notes

Desktop uses a premium three-card carousel stage with a stronger center card. Tablet and mobile show one main active card. Mobile media remains prominent while content, chips, CTA buttons, dots, and trust notes remain visible without horizontal overflow.

## 11. Performance notes

The implementation uses no animation library, no new dependency, no real media assets, no video playback, and no remote requests. Motion is limited to CSS transforms/transitions and a single interval when reduced motion is not requested.

## 12. No backend/database/SEO changes confirmation

Confirmed not changed or added:

- database migrations;
- Supabase files;
- API routes;
- admin routes;
- backend logic;
- package files;
- sitemap files;
- robots files;
- `llms.txt`;
- generated database types;
- seed files;
- public route creation.

## 13. Validation results

## 15. Next PR recommendation

UI-K-HOME-2026-F — Offers Page Planning or Footer/Trust Polish

## 16. FIX01 polish summary

PR #162-FIX01 keeps the existing provider-led carousel implementation and applies targeted polish only to the Special Offers Showcase.

FIX01 changes:

- improved mobile top rhythm with local section `scroll-margin-block-start` and tighter-but-safe mobile top padding so the badge/headline remains readable under the sticky mobile header;
- reduced mobile card height by tightening media height, body gaps, chip spacing, CTA sizing, and card max width;
- upgraded image/video-ready placeholders with richer layered gradients, category accent depth, glass highlights, refined play/photo treatments, and softer premium shadows;
- enhanced controlled emotional color by refining dental, beauty, labs, pet, center, doctor, and wellness accent tokens without introducing loud discount styling;
- strengthened desktop hierarchy with clearer active-card scale/elevation and calmer side cards that remain visible and readable;
- refined arrows/dots so carousel controls feel integrated and do not dominate the section;
- preserved preview-safe non-navigating CTAs, no fake prices/discounts/ratings/availability, and no route/backend behavior.

## 17. FIX01 mobile spacing and card-height polish

Mobile spacing now gives the section enough local top breathing room for sticky-header contexts without adding a large blank gap. The mobile card is shorter and cleaner: the media area remains prominent, while provider name, offer title, chips, CTAs, and trust note sit closer together with compact but tappable controls.

## 18. FIX01 media slot visual polish

The media slot remains asset-free and future-ready. FIX01 adds layered ivory/teal/champagne gradients, subtle category accent orbs, glass panels, refined label pills, a more premium video play button, and a more polished photo-frame shape. No real images, generated images, remote assets, video files, or autoplay were added.

## 19. FIX01 controlled color enhancement

The section now uses slightly warmer and more emotional accent tuning while staying premium:

- dental: soft aqua/teal;
- beauty: restrained rose/champagne;
- labs: clean clinical blue/cyan;
- pet: soft green/mint;
- centers: teal/ivory/champagne;
- doctors: blue-teal trust tone;
- wellness: sage/warm neutral.

## 20. FIX01 desktop active-card hierarchy

Desktop keeps the three-card carousel but gives the active card clearer elevation, scale, and saturation. Side cards are calmer through subtle opacity, scale, and shadow reduction while remaining visible and readable.

## 21. FIX01 Arabic/RTL notes

Arabic and RTL behavior remains local to the showcase. FIX01 preserves logical-start alignment, avoids negative Arabic letter spacing, keeps CTAs compact, and maintains flexible wrapping for Arabic labels/chips to avoid clipping.

## 22. FIX01 validation results

Required validation commands for FIX01:

- `git status --short`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm routes:check`

Validation completed for FIX01:

- `git status --short` showed only the approved Special Offers CSS and completion documentation changed before commit.
- `pnpm lint` passed with existing repository warnings only.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm build` passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` passed.

## 23. FIX01 merge-readiness recommendation

PR #162-FIX01 is intended to be merge-ready if visual QA confirms the mobile heading is readable, mobile cards feel shorter and cleaner, media slots feel premium, desktop hierarchy is clear, Arabic/RTL remains unclipped, and validation passes.

## 24. FIX02 summary

PR #162-FIX02 fixes the mobile card rendering blocker and applies final Special Offers-only polish. The carousel remains provider-led, preview-safe, route-free, backend-free, and dependency-free.

FIX02 changes:

- restored reliable mobile card rendering by forcing the active mobile card into a normal visible flex/block flow;
- made the mobile stage and shell overflow-visible where card content needs normal page scroll;
- disabled the full-card preview overlay on the active/mobile card so it cannot interfere with mobile stacking or content visibility;
- removed the duplicate in-body media badge so cards now keep one category badge, one Special Offer badge, and one media badge;
- strengthened the desktop headline locally without changing font family or global typography;
- improved active/side-card hierarchy while keeping side cards readable;
- added final mobile CTA, Arabic wrapping, media slot, and safe-area polish.

## 25. FIX02 mobile card rendering bug root cause

The mobile bug came from the showcase inheriting too much desktop carousel structure on small screens: grid-row sizing, transformed carousel cards, `overflow: hidden` shells/cards, and the full-card absolute preview overlay created a fragile stacking/clipping context. In that state the colored card/media surface could remain visible while the body content appeared clipped or not reliably visible in mobile layouts.

FIX02 addresses the root cause by switching the active mobile card to a normal visible column flow, making the mobile shell/stage/card overflow visible, explicitly restoring body visibility, and disabling the full-card preview overlay on mobile/active cards.

## 26. FIX02 mobile visibility fix

Mobile now guarantees the active card can show:

- media slot;
- category badge;
- Special Offer preview badge;
- Photo-ready or Video-ready badge;
- provider name;
- provider type;
- area/city;
- offer title;
- short description;
- chips;
- View offer / عرض التفاصيل CTA;
- View profile / عرض الملف CTA;
- trust note;
- dots/progress indicator.

The card remains compact but is not clipped into a fixed carousel viewport.

## 27. FIX02 heading typography polish

The desktop section headline now has stronger local weight and balanced line wrapping while keeping the existing DrMuscat font family and typography system. Arabic receives a separate local weight/line-height treatment with zero negative letter spacing.

## 28. FIX02 media slot polish

The media placeholder remains asset-free. FIX02 keeps the premium layered gradient/photo/video treatment and improves stacking so glass labels, play/photo elements, and media depth stay visible above decorative layers.

## 29. FIX02 carousel hierarchy polish

Desktop keeps the three-card stage. The active card is more clearly featured through elevation and scale, while side cards remain readable with calmer opacity and subtle hover/focus recovery.

## 30. FIX02 Arabic/RTL notes

FIX02 adds mobile wrapping protections for Arabic provider names, descriptions, labels, chips, and CTA buttons. RTL headline letter spacing remains zero, alignment stays logical-start, and CTA buttons remain visible and tappable.

## 31. FIX02 validation results

Required validation commands for FIX02:

- `git status --short`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm routes:check`

Validation completed for FIX02:

- `git status --short` showed only the approved Special Offers component, CSS, and completion documentation changed before commit.
- `pnpm lint` passed with existing repository warnings only.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm build` passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` passed.

## 32. FIX02 merge-readiness recommendation

PR #162-FIX02 is intended to be merge-ready if visual QA confirms the active mobile card fully renders on `/en/om` and `/ar/om`, CTAs are visible/tappable, desktop headline and carousel hierarchy feel premium, media placeholders feel photo/video-ready, Arabic is unclipped, and validation passes.

## 33. FIX04 media slot aspect ratio polish

PR #162-FIX04 is a micro UI polish pass for the Special Offers Showcase media slot only. It keeps the existing carousel, copy, typography, colors, controls, dots, routes, and backend-free preview behavior unchanged.

FIX04 adjusts the mobile media slot toward a more useful future photo/video poster shape by increasing the mobile media area height slightly and applying a local `4 / 3` aspect-ratio intent with a capped block size. This improves photo/video readiness without making the full mobile card excessively tall.

## 34. FIX04 mobile photo/video readiness note

The media slot remains placeholder-only: no real images, generated images, external assets, video files, or autoplay were added. Provider details, chips, CTAs, trust note, Arabic/RTL wrapping, and normal page scroll remain preserved below the media area.

## 35. FIX04 unchanged-scope confirmation

FIX04 did not change:

- carousel behavior or auto-rotation;
- previous/next controls;
- dots/progress indicators;
- English or Arabic copy;
- typography family or global typography;
- color palette;
- routes;
- backend/API/database/Supabase/SEO/package files;
- unrelated homepage sections.

## 36. FIX04 validation results

Required validation commands for FIX04:

- `git status --short`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm routes:check`

Validation completed for FIX04:

- `git status --short` showed only the approved Special Offers CSS and completion documentation changed before commit.
- `pnpm lint` passed with existing repository warnings only.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm build` passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` passed.

## 37. FIX04 merge-readiness recommendation

PR #162-FIX04 is intended to be merge-ready if visual QA confirms the mobile media slot feels better prepared for future photo/video posters while the full mobile card remains readable, compact, and stable in English and Arabic.

## 38. FIX05 desktop-only media slot polish

PR #162-FIX05 is a desktop-only micro polish pass for the Special Offers Showcase card media slot. It uses a `min-width: 68.01rem` media query so the accepted mobile layout, mobile media slot, mobile card height, mobile CTA spacing, and mobile carousel behavior remain unchanged.

FIX05 increases the desktop media/photo/video slot slightly by adjusting the desktop card row allocation and media minimum height. The goal is to use existing desktop card breathing room near the lower portion of the card so future photo and video poster uploads have a more useful presentation area.

## 39. FIX05 text and readability confirmation

FIX05 does not shrink or compress text. It does not reduce provider detail text, offer title text, chips, CTA labels, or trust-note readability. It only adjusts desktop media row sizing and body placement so content continues to sit naturally below the larger media slot.

## 40. FIX05 desktop photo/video readiness note

The media slot remains placeholder-only. No real images, generated images, external assets, video files, autoplay, copy changes, carousel behavior changes, color changes, or route/backend changes were introduced.

## 41. FIX05 validation results

Required validation commands for FIX05:

- `git status --short`
- `pnpm lint`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm routes:check`

Validation completed for FIX05:

- `git status --short` showed only the approved Special Offers CSS and completion documentation changed before commit.
- `pnpm lint` passed with existing repository warnings only.
- `pnpm typecheck` passed.
- `pnpm build` passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` passed.

## 42. FIX05 merge-readiness recommendation

PR #162-FIX05 is intended to be merge-ready if visual QA confirms desktop media/photo/video slots feel slightly taller and better prepared for future posters while desktop card height and carousel stability remain visually consistent, and mobile remains unchanged.
