# UI-K-HOME-2026-FULL Completion Report — Premium Homepage Shell with Search and Rotating Ads

## 1. Problems found before this fix

- Search still felt too close to a normal form rather than a premium command center.
- The sponsored visibility/ads section was present but not visible or premium enough and did not behave like a rotating spotlight carousel.
- Care stories, offers, article guides and provider/profile shells still read as safe placeholders rather than polished product inventory shells.
- Header included Sign in and Create account but they needed to remain visually clear while staying route-safe.
- Arabic headings needed tighter, more premium scaling and line-height safeguards.
- The homepage flow needed search first, then spotlight/ads, then discovery stories and lower sections.

## 2. Files changed

## 3. Header/sign-in/create-account/language switch result

- The page keeps exactly one official global header.
- Header includes DrMuscat, Home, Doctors, Centers, Labs, Pharmacies, Services, Hospitals, Offers, Articles, For Providers, Sign in, Create account and language switch.
- Approved routes remain real links only.
- Hospitals, Offers, Articles, Sign in and Create account remain disabled/preview-safe pills because supported routes do not exist and route-check must not be weakened.
- English page shows only `العربية` as the language switch.
- Arabic page shows only `English` as the language switch.

## 4. Premium search command center result

- Search remains the first primary homepage product element.
- The command center has one dominant large search input, content-type chips, provider-type chips, country/city/area filters, curated suggestion chips and bottom CTAs.
- Main input placeholders are:
  - English: “Search doctors, clinics, services, offers or areas…”
  - Arabic: “ابحث عن طبيب، عيادة، خدمة، عرض أو منطقة…”
- Search submits to the existing approved search route with query parameters only.
- No live backend, autocomplete API, Supabase query or real ranking was added.

## 6. Rotating ads/spotlight carousel result

- Added a full-width premium `DrMuscat Spotlight` section directly after the search/hero top and before care stories.
- Implemented CSS-only rotating spotlight cards with a rotating orb/lens visual.
- Carousel items:
  - Homepage Featured Placement
  - Category Featured
  - Area Featured
  - Offers Spotlight
  - Article Sponsored Placement
- Arabic equivalents are included.
- Disclaimer is visible: “Sponsored visibility is paid placement, not quality ranking.” / “الظهور المموّل مساحة مدفوعة وليس ترتيباً لجودة الخدمة.”
- No prices, billing, wallet, checkout or ad backend were added.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the animation and keeps the first spotlight card visible.

## 7. Care stories result

- Care Stories remain immediately after the search/spotlight flow.
- The story rail uses premium orb/lens cards and stronger spacing.
- Story labels are Dental, Beauty, Kids, Pet Clinic, Labs, Offers, Articles and For Providers, with Arabic equivalents.
- No modal behavior or medical advice was added.

## 8. Offers/doctors/articles/providers sections result

- Featured Doctors / Centers shells now use more product-like premium cards with orb/silhouette media placeholders and explicit safe review/approval copy.
- Offers now read as future approved offer inventory without prices, guaranteed outcomes or medical claims.
- Articles are styled as magazine-style guide previews and remain educational only.
- Provider CTA includes List your center, View provider options and disabled Create account preview while documenting that auth/dashboard/payment are inactive.

## 9. Arabic typography fixes

- Arabic hero and section headings use smaller RTL clamps, comfortable line-height and no negative letter spacing.
- Spotlight headings have dedicated RTL sizing.
- Chips and cards wrap safely for Arabic labels.

## 10. RTL/mobile/accessibility/performance notes

- Semantic sections, headings, labels, fieldsets, buttons and links are used.
- Pending header/account items are non-links with disabled semantics.
- Search chips remain keyboard-operable native radio controls or submit buttons.
- Mobile search stacks cleanly; CTA buttons become full-width where needed.
- Horizontal rails use CSS only.
- Carousel is CSS-only and respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- No new dependency, remote font, heavy JS, large image, background video or client-only SEO-critical content was added.

## 11. SEO/route safety notes

- Supported locales remain `en` and `ar`; supported country remains `om`.
- No Persian/Hindi route expansion.
- No sitemap, robots or llms changes.
- No schema.org output or fake structured data.
- No sign-in, create-account, offers, articles or hospital route was added.
- Disabled/pending header items are not dead links.

## 12. Forbidden areas untouched

Confirmed untouched:

- `supabase/**`
- `migrations/**`
- `scripts/db/**`
- generated database types
- API routes
- auth backend
- payment backend
- `src/app/sitemap.ts`
- `src/app/robots.ts`
- `public/llms.txt`
- `package.json`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`
- database schema
- seed data
- route-check scripts
- `src/lib/routes/public.ts`
- `src/lib/i18n/config.ts`

## 13. Validation results

- `git status --short` — run before commit.
- `pnpm lint` — passed with existing repository warnings and no errors.
- `pnpm typecheck` — passed.
- `pnpm build` — passed.
- `pnpm routes:check` — passed.
- Forbidden path/content scans — passed.
- Built-page HTML checks for `/en/om` and `/ar/om` — passed.

## 14. Remaining limitations

- Sign in and Create account remain disabled/preview-safe because no approved auth routes/backend are in scope.
- Hospitals, Offers and Articles remain disabled/preview-safe in the header because those route families are not approved.
- Search is UI-only/static-safe and does not perform live autocomplete, provider ranking or backend search.
- Ads/spotlight carousel is a premium UI shell only with no advertiser backend, pricing, checkout or billing.
- Screenshot tooling was unavailable in the container, so visual QA relied on build output, HTML checks and CSS review.
