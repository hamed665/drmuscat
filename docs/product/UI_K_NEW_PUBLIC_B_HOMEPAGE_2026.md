## Old homepage components disconnected

The homepage route no longer imports or renders:

- `HomeHero`
- `HomeCategoryPreview`
- `HomeTrustStrip`

Those legacy components were not edited. They remain available for any other existing references but are disconnected from the `/[locale]/[country]` homepage route.

## New public-2026 components added

A new isolated `src/components/public-2026/` tree was added for the 2026 homepage direction. The tree contains typed home, search, section, card, and small UI primitives. The visible homepage is search-first, keeps articles lower on the page, and uses honest preview/coming-soon copy instead of fake ratings, review counts, provider counts, or medical claims.

## Route switch details

`src/app/[locale]/[country]/page.tsx` now preserves:

- `generateMetadata`
- supported locale/country validation
- `notFound()` behavior for unsupported params
- the existing canonical URL format

Only the rendered homepage tree was replaced with `HomePage2026`.

## SEO safety confirmation

- No sitemap file was changed.
- No robots file was changed.
- No `public/llms.txt` file was changed.
- No new public route files or URL patterns were added.
- Homepage metadata behavior and canonical path format were preserved.
- No schema.org markup was added.

## Backend, database, Supabase, and RLS confirmation

No backend, API route, auth, payment, Supabase, migration, generated type, seed, or RLS files were changed. The search and location controls are UI-only and do not call backend search, geolocation, Supabase, or APIs.

## Limitations

- Search input, suggestion groups, country/city/area selection, featured providers, and article cards are UI-only placeholders.
- Oman is active in the selector; UAE, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iran are shown as coming soon.
- Area options depend on the selected Oman city in the UI only.
- Existing site header and footer remain in place because this phase is homepage-only.

## Next recommended phase

`UI-K-NEW-PUBLIC-C — Public header/footer replacement or homepage shell refinement`

## FIX01 correction notes

`UI-K-NEW-PUBLIC-B-FIX01` corrected the first 2026 homepage implementation to better match the Claude Design reference while keeping production guardrails:

- Header localization was corrected so English shows `DrMuscat` and Arabic shows `دكتور مسقط` as the visible primary wordmark.
- Header navigation labels are locale-specific and compact in both English and Arabic.
- Footer was adjusted to a dark premium, bilingual-safe structure with Discover, For Providers, Support, and About columns, without adding unapproved route files.
- Homepage typography and `dm2026-*` styling were refined with project tokens and local font stacks only; no remote font loading or package changes were introduced.
- The search hero was strengthened to a large central Claude-style rounded card with dominant search input, clean selectors, chips, and grouped suggestions.
- The location selector now uses strict Country → City → Area behavior, with Oman active and other countries marked coming soon.
- Featured preview cards now show visible View profile, WhatsApp, Call, and Directions action UI without inventing real phone numbers, WhatsApp links, ratings, reviews, or provider counts.
- Category, area, and article cards were made more polished and public-safe while routing only to existing approved discovery routes.

No backend, database, Supabase, RLS, sitemap, robots, llms, route-check, package, lockfile, or generated database type files were changed in FIX01.
