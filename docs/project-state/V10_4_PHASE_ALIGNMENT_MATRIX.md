# V10.4 Phase Alignment Matrix

## Purpose

This file is documentation-only. It maps the current DrMuscat repository state to the existing V10.4 architecture and does not authorize implementation.

Future work must declare:

1. Execution Phase
2. Lock Scope
3. Product Module
4. Subphase ID

If this file conflicts with `docs/master-spec/`, the master spec wins. If it conflicts with `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or `docs/project-state/CURRENT_STATE.md`, the stricter current-state or safety instruction wins.

## Current Repository Baseline

- Import-readiness runtime is aligned through PR #943 at baseline `74541b9f32acb201a9bf94d54d0be757842f5b8c` (last aligned 2026-07-15).
- Migrations validate through `0079_import_pharmacy_atomic_authorization_reservation.sql`.
- The current next implementation is `RES-INTEGRITY-READBACK`.
- Current foundations include public catalog/detail pages, static public article shell routes, provider onboarding lead capture, callback request capture, protected root `/admin`, minimal admin login, lead list/detail, limited lead mutation, lead history, draft center creation from lead, center subscription view/assignment, base plan initializer, admin quick navigation, and admin commercial add-on assignment shell.
- The commercial add-on shell creates draft/internal Homepage Ads and Special Offer Placement assignments only.
- Article pages are still static shell pages only.
- Official Offers, public commercial rendering, article CMS, article placement engine, AI content workflows, live financial workflows, real seed rows, provider dashboard mutations, sales/referral/reporting expansion, and other business expansion features remain out of scope unless explicitly approved.

| Capability | Current Status | Execution Phase | Lock Scope | Product Module | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Public catalog/detail foundations | Completed baseline | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Phase 3 / Phase 9 | Limited to `en`/`ar` and `om`. |
| Static public article shell | Completed shell | Phase 3 | Phase 4 | Phase 9 | No article CMS or placement engine. |
| Provider onboarding lead capture | Completed baseline | Phase 5 | Phase 6 | Phase 5 | Broader provider workflows remain gated. |

| Lead status/priority mutation and history | Partially completed baseline | Phase 4 | Phase 5 | Phase 6 / Phase 12 | Event types remain constrained by their existing migration contract. |
| Draft center creation from lead | Completed admin baseline | Phase 4 / Phase 5 | Phase 5 / Phase 6 | Phase 5 / Phase 6 | Uses `note_added` with `event_kind: draft_center_created`. |
| Center subscription view/assignment | Completed foundation | Phase 6 | Phase 9 / Phase 5 | Phase 7 / Phase 15 | Admin assignment only. |
| Commercial add-on assignment shell | Completed draft/internal shell | Phase 6 | Phase 8 / Phase 5 | Phase 15 | Homepage Ads and Special Offer Placement only. |
| Migrations through `0079` | Completed | Phase 2 | Phase 2 / Phase 3 | Phase 1 / Phase 2 | Existing SQL migrations must not be modified unless approved. |
| Review companion foundation | Foundation only | Phase 2 | Phase 2 / Phase 3 | Phase 10 | Full review product is not implemented. |

## Import readiness baseline

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Aligned through | PR #943 |
| Runtime baseline | `74541b9f32acb201a9bf94d54d0be757842f5b8c` |
| Last aligned | `2026-07-15` |
| Current migration | `0079_import_pharmacy_atomic_authorization_reservation.sql` |
| Current next | `RES-INTEGRITY-READBACK` |

## Import readiness capability mapping

This table maps current capability evidence to the canonical phase systems. The authoritative wave ledger remains in [`docs/import/import-readiness-roadmap-after-933.md`](../import/import-readiness-roadmap-after-933.md).

| Capability | Current status | Evidence | Next gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client-safe authorization | Complete | #936 | Maintain static checks |
| Canonical Pharmacy patch | Complete | #937 | Executor parity |
| Metadata/locale preservation | Complete | #938 | Publish/rollback regression |
| Stable operation identity | Complete | #939 | Replay proof |
| Persisted authorization | Complete | #940 | Lifecycle regression |
| Invalidation/readback | Complete | #941 | Bounded UI regression |
| Atomic reservation transaction | Implemented/partial wave | #942 | DB safety proof and audit split |
| Admin reserve operation | Implemented/partial wave | #943 | Integrity readback |
| Reservation integrity proof | Open | — | `RES-INTEGRITY-READBACK` |
| Existing private executor handoff | Open | — | `PRIVATE-RESERVATION-GATE` |
| Exact rollback recovery | Open | — | Wave 4 |
| Pharmacy public/index/sitemap | Disabled/Open | — | After Admin canary |
| AI-assisted intake | Planned | — | After intake convergence |
| Content/SEO Agent | Planned separate track | — | After CMS/automation authority |

The current reservation audit signature is `event_type=execution_started` with `event_payload.phase=reservation`; `reservation_created` is not implemented.

## Immediate task mapping

| Subphase | Execution Phase | Lock Scope | Product Module |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ALIGN-CURRENT-STATE` | Phase 9 | Phase 10 | Phase 6 |
| `RES-INTEGRITY-READBACK` | Phase 9 | Phase 10 | Phase 6 |
| `RES-DB-SAFETY-PROOF` | Phase 2 | Phase 3 | Phase 2 |
| `PRIVATE-RESERVATION-GATE` | Phase 2 | Phase 10 | Phase 6 |
| `PRIVATE-ADMIN-WIRING` | Phase 4 | Phase 10 | Phase 6 |
| `ROLLBACK-AUTHORITY-HARDENING` | Phase 9 | Phase 11 | Phase 6 |
| `ROLLBACK-EXACT-RECOVERY` | Phase 9 | Phase 11 | Phase 18 |
| `ADMIN-STATE-MACHINE` | Phase 4 | Phase 5 | Phase 6 |
| `REAL-ADMIN-CANARY` | Phase 9 | Phase 11 | Phase 18 |

This is the primary mapping and must be confirmed against current `main` before each PR. Program milestones do not replace the canonical phase systems.

## Future Subphase ID Namespace

| Namespace | Intended use |
| --- | --- |
| `ALIGN-*` | Repo/spec/current-state alignment. |
| `ADM-*` | Admin operations and approved admin workflows. |
| `CENTER-*` | Center creation/conversion/admin center operations. |
| `MON-*` | Monetization, plans, billing terms, add-ons. |
| `ADS-*` | Ads product and sponsored campaign workflows. |
| `OFF-*` | Official Offers model and offer approval workflows. |
| `ART-*` | Article CMS, article rendering, article admin workflows. |
| `PLAC-*` | Placement slots across articles, homepage, offers, area, and specialty pages. |

## Upcoming Expansion Mapping

This table is mapping only, not implementation approval.

| Expansion | Recommended Namespace | Status | Key Rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Official Offers | `OFF-*` | Not started | Must exist before real Special Offer Placement can point to approved offers. |
| Fuller Ads options | `ADS-*` / `MON-*` | Not started | Must stay labeled and separated from organic ranking. |
| Article CMS | `ART-*` | Not started | Must be CMS-driven before DB-backed article publishing. |
| Article placement engine | `PLAC-*` | Not started | Must use slots and density rules. |
| AI content intelligence | `AI-*` / `SEO-*` | Not started | AI may suggest and draft only after approval workflows exist. |
| Provider Marketing Hub | `PROV-*` / `MON-*` / `ANL-*` | Not started | Provider self-service should come after admin controls. |
| Sales Agent Panel | `SALES-*` / `ADM-*` | Not started | Internal/admin only unless explicitly expanded. |
| Referral/reward program | `REF-*` / `MON-*` / `ANL-*` | Not started | Requires attribution/reward controls. |
| Analytics/reporting | `ANL-*` | Not started | Must not expose private data or manipulate organic ranking. |

## Retired Informal Labels

- `Phase 5.20` is retired.
- `Phase 5.26` is retired.
- `Phase 5.27` is retired.
- Future prompts must not use these labels as canonical phase numbers.

## Validation Commands for Documentation-Only Alignment Tasks

Documentation-only alignment tasks should run:

- `pnpm env:check`
- `pnpm db:validate:migrations`
- `pnpm db:validate:seeds`
- `pnpm test:db:rls`
- `pnpm test:db:seed`
- `pnpm routes:check`
- `pnpm seo:check`
- `pnpm typecheck`
- `pnpm build`
- `pnpm lint`

Validation commands must not be faked or skipped silently.

## Stop Conditions and Ambiguity Handling

- Stop if a task needs files outside the allowed lock scope.
- Stop if phase mapping is unclear.
- Stop if implementation would require migrations, RLS, routes, source code, validators, business logic, or UI outside the approved task.
- Stop if business expansion would be implemented without explicit approval.
- Stop rather than guessing.
- Do not fake passing tests.
