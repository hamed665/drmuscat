### Scaffold or planned SEO route families present

| Route family | Current state | DB reads | Metadata/schema | Sitemap | Future recommendation | Key files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/:locale/:country/centers/:specialtySlug` | Fail-closed scaffold; calls `notFound()`. | No. | No meaningful output because route does not render. | No. | Implement only after specialty relationship policy and QA gate. | `src/app/[locale]/[country]/centers/[specialtySlug]/page.tsx` |
| `/:locale/:country/centers/:specialtySlug/:areaSlug` | Fail-closed scaffold; calls `notFound()`. | No. | No. | No. | Implement after specialty+area counts, canonical uniqueness, and content thresholds. | `src/app/[locale]/[country]/centers/[specialtySlug]/[areaSlug]/page.tsx` |
| `/:locale/:country/areas/:areaSlug` | Fail-closed scaffold; calls `notFound()`. | No. | No. | No. | Implement after Oman geo model, area uniqueness, and local content QA. | `src/app/[locale]/[country]/areas/[areaSlug]/page.tsx` |

### Admin route families

Admin routes are root-level, non-localized, protected by the admin layout/auth baseline, and should be blocked/noindex in future crawler policy. They are not in the sitemap.

| Route family | Current state | Operational vs shell | Key files |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/admin` | Protected control center dashboard. | Real navigation/status overview; many modules are status shells. | `src/app/admin/page.tsx`, `src/lib/admin/control-center.ts` |
| `/admin/login` | Minimal Supabase magic-link login. | Operational baseline. | `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/login/actions.ts`, `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts` |
| Provider onboarding leads | List/detail, limited status/priority mutation, event history. | Operational baseline. | `src/app/admin/provider-onboarding-leads/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/provider-onboarding-leads/[leadId]/page.tsx` |
| Draft centers | List/detail and creation from lead foundation. | Foundation, not full publish workflow. | `src/app/admin/draft-centers/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/draft-centers/[centerId]/page.tsx` |
| Commercial assignment pages | Homepage Ads/Special Offer Placement assignment shell. | Foundation/shell only; no public commercial rendering. | `src/app/admin/commercial-addons/page.tsx` |
| Media library | Metadata/review/archive list/detail. | Foundation; upload/picker/assignment flow disabled/missing. | `src/app/admin/media/page.tsx`, `src/app/admin/media/[mediaId]/page.tsx` |
| CMS core | Content entries, revisions, preview routes. | Admin storage foundation; public CMS rollout limited. | `src/app/admin/content/**`, `supabase/migrations/0060_admin_cms_core_revision_foundation.sql` |
| FAQ CMS | FAQ list/new/detail/preview routes. | Pilot foundation. | `src/app/admin/content/faqs/**` |
| Audit log | Admin audit event viewing foundation. | Foundation. | `src/app/admin/audit-log/page.tsx`, `supabase/migrations/0058_admin_audit_events.sql` |
| Settings/roles overview | Settings overview. | Shell/foundation for roles/permissions visibility. | `src/app/admin/settings/page.tsx`, `src/lib/admin/roles.ts` |

## 2. Current public data query audit

All public catalog helpers use `createSupabaseServerClient()` and therefore should rely on Supabase RLS plus explicit public filters where present. Current helper filters are lightweight and often omit `status = active`, `is_active = true`, and `deleted_at IS NULL` in application code, so the public/private boundary depends heavily on RLS policies.

| Helper | Tables read | Public fields exposed | Filters/pagination | Error behavior | SEO/private-boundary risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `listPublicDoctors` | `doctors`. | id, slug, names, title/gender, country. | `limit` clamped 1-50; optional `default_country`; no specialty/area/service filter. | Returns empty fallback with `query_error`. | If RLS/policies are incomplete, inactive/deleted/thin doctors could list; no offset/cursor for large directories. |
| `getPublicDoctorBySlug` | `doctors`, `specialties`, `doctor_services`, `doctor_practice_locations`, `centers`, geo tables, `provider_license_records`, `entity_media`, `media_assets`. | Names, title/gender, bio, experience, primary specialty, services, practice centers/locations, approved contact actions, approved public license, approved public media. | slug + optional country; child limits clamped; no active filters in helper. | Query error returns fallback null; page turns missing data into `notFound()`. | Profile may be orphaned from sitemap and listing if relation data is incomplete; null on query errors can create temporary 404s. |
| `listPublicCenters` | `centers`. | id, slug, bilingual names/descriptions, center type, default country. | `limit` clamped; optional country and `centerType`; no area/service/specialty filter. | Empty fallback on error. | Heavy reliance on RLS for `status/is_active/deleted_at`; subtype pages can be thin. |
| `getPublicCenterBySlug` | `centers`, `center_locations`, geo tables, `center_services`, `services`, `doctor_practice_locations`, `doctors`, `provider_license_records`, `entity_media`, `media_assets`. | Bilingual names/descriptions, verification status, services, doctors, locations, approved contacts, approved license, logo/cover/gallery. | slug + optional country; child limits clamped. | Query error returns null; page `notFound()`. | Profile may 404 on transient child query error; schema absent despite rich visible content. |
| `listPublicServices` | `services`. | id, slug, bilingual names/descriptions, category. | `limit` clamped; optional category; no active/deleted filter in helper. | Empty fallback on error. | Service slug is unique only per taxonomy group, so future `/services/:slug` risks ambiguity. |
| `listPublicGeoAreas` | `geo_areas`. | id, slug, bilingual names, city/country ids. | `limit` clamped; optional countryId/cityId. | Empty fallback on error. | Area slug is unique per city, not country-wide; local pages can cannibalize/soft-404 if implemented too early. |
| `searchPublicCatalog` | `centers`, `doctors`, `services`, `geo_areas`. | Same summary fields as list helpers. | Sanitizes query; min length 2; `ilike` on name/slug; clamped limit; no country filter in options observed. | Empty typed search result on error or too-short query. | Search result pages are not good index targets; no advanced ranking, no typo/alias support, no noindex metadata currently observed. |
| Public media helpers | `entity_media`, `media_assets`. | public URL, mime, dimensions, alt/caption, usage kind, primary/featured/sort. | Helper accepts only image jpeg/png/webp/avif and approved usage kinds; query filters should ensure public visibility/review. | Invalid media silently omitted; parent helper errors if query fails. | Missing responsive variants and assignment workflow; fallback alt text is generic. |
| Public contact helpers | Center/location/doctor location contact fields from catalog queries. | `tel:` and `wa.me` links only when public visibility flags and `contact_review_status = approved` pass. | Normalizes Oman WhatsApp digits. | Invalid/unapproved values omitted. | Boundary is good for contact fields, but no report-correction loop exists. |
| Public license helper | `provider_license_records`. | License number, authority, country. | Requires matching entity, `deleted_at IS NULL`, `public_license_visible = true`, `license_review_status = approved`, safe text. | Omitted on error or invalid data. | Center and doctor licenses are separated; no department/service license layer or `last_checked/source` public trust fields. |

## 3. Sitemap, robots, and `llms.txt` audit

- `src/app/sitemap.ts` is static-code driven. It includes localized roots, discovery routes (`doctors`, `dental`, `centers`, `labs`, `pharmacies`, `hospitals`, `offers`, `beauty`, `pet-clinics`, `pet-shops`, `services`, `search`), and `/for-providers`.
- Dynamic doctor URLs, center URLs, article details, specialty pages, service pages, service+area pages, area pages, and local pages are not included.
- `lastModified` uses `new Date()` at request/build time, not entity `updated_at`; this is unsuitable for 10k+ pages because every URL can appear freshly modified.
- The current sitemap is not ready for large dynamic inventory; it needs paging/sitemap index strategy, DB-backed public-safe projections, per-entity timestamps, and indexability thresholds.
- `src/app/robots.ts` allows `/` for all user agents and points to the sitemap. It does not explicitly disallow `/admin`, `/auth`, internal preview routes, search URLs, or private/admin surfaces.
- `public/llms.txt` is stale. It lists only early public routes and says provider data/listings/profiles are not yet public, while doctor and center profile routes now exist.
- Future Prompt 28 should update crawler policy for `OAI-SearchBot`, `ChatGPT-User`, and `GPTBot` explicitly, but this audit does not change those files.

## 4. Metadata, canonical, and hreflang audit

- `metadataBase` is `siteConfig.baseUrl`, derived from `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`, development localhost fallback, or production `https://drmuscat.com`.
- `buildLocalizedMetadata()` generates canonical URLs from the route pathname + locale + country.
- Language alternates include English and Arabic equivalents for the same pathname.
- `x-default` points to `languageAlternates.en`, currently the English country root (`/en/om`), not necessarily the equivalent page. This is acceptable for a root-only default but suboptimal for detail and discovery pages.
- Doctor metadata uses the doctor display name for title and a bio/specialty/practice-location style description fallback.
- Center metadata uses the center display name and description fallback.
- Discovery pages have in-code localized title/description copy.
- Missing risks: no per-entity hreflang validation against actual localized completeness, no noindex control for search/thin scaffolds that render, no canonical conflict resolver for future area/service ambiguous slugs, and no metadata sourced from public-safe projection/QA status.

## 5. Structured data audit

- Existing JSON-LD helpers support `Organization`, `WebSite`, `BreadcrumbList`, `FAQPage`, `Physician`, `MedicalClinic`, `MedicalOrganization`, `Pharmacy`, `DiagnosticLab`, and `MedicalTest` types.
- In current route usage, FAQ JSON-LD is emitted on several discovery/vertical pages from static visible FAQ copy.
- Doctor detail routes do not currently emit Physician JSON-LD.
- Center/hospital/pharmacy/lab routes do not currently emit LocalBusiness/Hospital/MedicalClinic/Pharmacy/DiagnosticLab JSON-LD mapping.
- BreadcrumbList helpers exist but route-level breadcrumb JSON-LD/visible breadcrumbs are not broadly implemented.
- No implemented mapping was found for `Dentist`, `BeautySalon`, `HealthClub`, `VeterinaryCare`, or `PetStore`.
- Future schema mapping must be based on visible page content, public-safe license/contact/media fields, taxonomy/entity category mapping, and QA/indexability decisions.

## 6. Internal linking audit

- Doctor listing cards link to doctor profile routes.
- Center listing cards link to center profile routes.
- Center detail pages include associated doctor summaries that can link to doctor profiles where IDs/slugs exist.
- Doctor detail pages include practice center/location summaries that can link to center profiles where IDs/slugs exist.
- Current services on detail pages are displayed as service summaries; service page route linking is not yet safe because service slug ambiguity remains unresolved.
- Location names are displayed but should not link to area/city pages until geo uniqueness and local page QA are implemented.
- Discovery pages link mostly to current route families and provider CTA surfaces; they do not have a graph-driven related entity engine.
- Breadcrumb UI/JSON-LD is missing or not broad enough for future route depth.
- Related blocks are manual/limited rather than generated from an entity relation graph.
- Orphan risk is high for dynamic doctor and center profiles because sitemap omits them and relation completeness depends on listings/detail associations.

## 7. Existing taxonomy and geo audit

- Core taxonomy tables exist: `taxonomy_groups`, `service_categories`, `services`, and `specialties`.
- Newer taxonomy foundation exists for `healthcare_verticals`, `center_categories`, and `center_category_assignments`, with public directory/profile flags and RLS for approved public taxonomy rows.
- Specialty hierarchy add-on fields exist: parent specialty, specialty level, clinical domain, age focus, flags for doctor specialty/primary care/surgical/dental, public directory/profile flags, and `specialty_aliases`.
- Existing `center_type` enum covers clinic, hospital, dental clinic, beauty clinic, laboratory, imaging center, pharmacy, wellness center, physiotherapy center, and other.
- Dental, hospital, pharmacy, lab, beauty, imaging, wellness, and physiotherapy are represented at enum/foundation level. Pet clinic and pet shop are not represented in `center_type` and need separate vertical/category decisions.
- IVF/fertility, mental health, counseling, optical, audiology, elderly care, vaccination/travel clinic, ambulance/emergency transport, home sample collection, speech therapy, occupational therapy, weight management, and telemedicine are not confirmed as complete public taxonomy seeds in the audited code. They require Prompt 2-4 taxonomy/geo planning and seed validation.
- Geo tables exist for countries, regions, cities, and areas with active/deleted fields and city-scoped area slugs.
- Current Oman geo coverage cannot be treated as complete for all governorates/wilayats/areas from schema alone; no complete approved Oman geo seed audit was found in this prompt.
- Geo aliases were not observed as implemented runtime tables; area slug ambiguity is documented in existing landing-page contracts.

## 8. License, claim, verification, and trust audit

- `provider_license_records` exists with separate center/doctor targeting, review status, public visibility, and public RLS gates.
- `centers` and `doctors` have `verification_status` fields.
- `center_claims` and `center_memberships` exist as foundations, but public ownership/claim workflow remains out of scope.
- Public license display is safe and conservative: only approved, visible, syntactically safe license numbers are exposed.
- Doctor license and entity license records are separated by `entity_type` plus mutually exclusive `center_id`/`doctor_id`.
- Department-level licensing and service-level license requirements are missing.
- Report incorrect info/correction request workflow was not observed as a public feature.
- Explicit public `source`, `source_version`, and `last_checked` trust fields for provider/entity facts are missing outside limited taxonomy source fields.

## 9. Media and image audit

- `media_assets` and `entity_media` support public media foundations; admin media fields add alt/caption EN/AR, usage kind, review status, visibility status, archive flag, and updater profile.
- Public media rendering supports center logo, cover, gallery images, and doctor profile images through `getPublicCenterMedia()` and `getPublicDoctorMedia()`.
- Public media helpers enforce approved public image mime types and sanitize alt/caption text; unsafe promotional caption patterns are suppressed.
- Public images expose width and height when stored, but there is no responsive image variant pipeline, CDN transformation model, or explicit size standard in current runtime.
- Upload/picker/assignment flow remains missing/disabled in admin foundation.
- Future standards are needed for card thumbnails, profile images, cover images, galleries, aspect ratios, minimum dimensions, alt text review, and performance budgets.
- Performance risk: large original public URLs may render without derivative sizes or responsive variants.

## 10. Admin/CMS audit

- Admin Control Center is real as a protected navigation/status surface, with explicit module statuses.
- Permissions/roles registry foundations exist, but broad fine-grained workflows remain limited.
- Audit log foundation exists via `admin_audit_events` and `/admin/audit-log`.
- Media library metadata foundation exists, but upload, picker, and public assignment workflows are not complete.
- CMS core entries/revisions exist with admin routes and revision/preview screens; public article CMS rendering is not live.
- FAQ CMS pilot/admin routes exist; public FAQ read rollout is limited to existing static/discovery behavior and foundations.
- Provider onboarding leads are operational for capture, list/detail, status/priority mutation, and history events.
- Draft center creation from onboarding lead exists, but draft center workflow does not equal full entity publishing.
- Center subscriptions/add-ons foundation exists; public paid placement rendering and billing are not active.
- Missing before bulk import and entity publishing: import staging tables, mapping UI, normalization, duplicate detection, import review queues, QA gates, publish projection, doctor admin, entity admin, taxonomy admin, source/last-checked fields, and safe activation workflow.

## 11. Risk register

| Risk | Severity | Recommended next prompt | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Orphan profile pages | High | Prompt 20-23 | Dynamic profiles render but are absent from sitemap and graph-driven related blocks. |

| Premature indexing of thin local pages | High | Prompt 10-11, 25-27 | Scaffold routes correctly fail closed; future pages need thresholds. |
| Duplicate doctor/entity records | High | Prompt 15 | No duplicate detection/import review foundation for bulk data. |
| Route cannibalization between centers/specialties/services/local pages | High | Prompt 2-4, 21-27 | Specialty/service/area slug ambiguity is unresolved. |
| Mixed medical and non-medical beauty topical dilution | Medium-High | Prompt 2, 24, 28 | Beauty pages need clear taxonomy/schema/noindex policy. |
| Missing license verification | High | Prompt 8 | License table exists, but broader verification and last-checked workflow is incomplete. |
| YMYL mental health risk | High | Prompt 2-3, 10, 24 | Mental health/counseling require stricter content/review/schema controls. |
| Schema mismatch risk | High | Prompt 24 | Schema helper types exist, but route-level entity schema is mostly absent. |
| No public/private projection boundary | High | Prompt 17 | Current helpers query base tables and rely on RLS; publish projection is needed. |
| Excel import directly into public tables risk | Critical | Prompt 12-16 | Bulk import must stage, normalize, dedupe, and review before publish. |
| Incomplete geo coverage | High | Prompt 4 | Oman governorate/wilayat/area completeness is not proven. |
| Missing internal linking graph | High | Prompt 20-22 | Current linking is manual/limited and cannot scale. |
| Missing source/last_checked fields | High | Prompt 8, 12, 17 | Trust and freshness cannot be reliably displayed or audited. |
