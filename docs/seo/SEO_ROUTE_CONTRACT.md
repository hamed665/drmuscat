# SEO Route Contract

## 1. Status and Authority

This document is documentation-only for SEO-C. It does not authorize implementation, product features, route creation, migrations, API handlers, UI changes, business logic, Supabase generated types, validators, route checks, RLS tests, SEO checks, seed rows, database imports, CMS records, public SEO pages, article routes, provider pages, branded hospital pages, programmatic pages, schema output, sitemap changes, robots changes, `llms.txt` changes, analytics events, crawlers, background jobs, AI chat, or payment/business workflows.

The URL strategy in this document does not authorize route creation. Canonical pattern documentation does not authorize sitemap, schema, robots, or `llms.txt` changes.

If this document conflicts with V10.4 master-spec files, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `docs/project-state/*`, current repository state, route checks, SEO-A, SEO-B, or stricter guardrails, the V10.4 master-spec, current repo state, route checks, and stricter guardrails win.

Future implementation requires a separate `PHASED_BUILD_ONLY` task with four-axis mapping, allowed files, forbidden scope, validation, and human approval. Keyword `target_url_pattern` and `route_status` values are planning data only and do not authorize route/page generation. Medical and branded-search URL usage requires future human approval where applicable.

## 2. Four-Axis Mapping

- Execution Phase: Phase 3 — Public SEO Platform
- Lock Scope: Phase 4 — Public SEO Pages / documentation-only planning for SEO-C
- Product Module: Phase 9 — SEO/CMS and Programmatic Pages
- Subphase ID: SEO-C

## 3. Route Classification Schema

Future route tables should use this classification schema when evaluating current, future, blocked, or non-SEO surfaces.

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `route_family` | Pattern or file being classified. |
| `status` | Contract status such as `current_approved`, `admin_private`, `api_non_seo`, `future_approval_required`, `blocked`, `unsupported_locale`, or `unsupported_country`. |
| `exists_now` | Whether the route/file exists in the current repository state. |
| `public_or_private` | `public`, `admin_private`, `api_non_seo`, `crawler_facing_file`, or `blocked`. |
| `indexability_status` | `indexable_candidate`, `noindex_required`, `blocked`, `unsupported_locale`, `unsupported_country`, or `future_approval_required`. |
| `sitemap_eligible` | Whether the route can be sitemap eligible under current rules. |
| `hreflang_allowed` | Whether approved `en`/`ar` hreflang counterparts may be referenced. |
| `canonical_family` | The canonical family to use, or `not_applicable`. |
| `implementation_authorization` | Whether the current document authorizes implementation; for SEO-C this is always `none`. |
| `human_review_required` | Whether human review is required before publication-oriented use. |
| `notes` | Route-specific constraints, conflicts, or stop conditions. |

## 4. Current Public Route Contract Table

These route families are current approved public route families for the current repository state. SEO-C does not authorize expansion or new implementation.

## 10. Doctor Detail Route Conflict Resolution

Current repo/current-state/routes-check contract is authoritative for this repository state.

- Approved doctor detail route family: `/[locale]/[country]/doctor/[doctorSlug]`.
- Forbidden unless future explicit route-contract approval changes it: `/[locale]/[country]/doctors/[doctorSlug]`.

Future work must not add the plural doctor detail route, link to it, include it in sitemap output, use it as a canonical URL, include it in hreflang alternates, or derive it from keyword `target_url_pattern` values unless a future approved task explicitly changes the route contract and validation rules.

## 11. Route Approval Model

Any future route implementation requires a separate approved `PHASED_BUILD_ONLY` task with:

- four-axis mapping
- route family list
- allowed files
- forbidden scope
- implementation authorization
- data source authorization
- route impact
- sitemap impact
- robots impact
- `llms.txt` impact
- canonical and hreflang rules
- noindex/index rules
- medical, branded, and compliance review requirements
- validation commands
- human approval checkpoint

No keyword, spreadsheet, SEO addendum, strategy document, planning-only route status, or `target_url_pattern` value authorizes route/page generation.

## 12. Route Validation Expectations

Future route implementation must pass validation without weakening TypeScript, lint, build, route, env, migration, seed, SEO, or RLS checks. For SEO-C documentation implementation, expected validation commands are:

```bash
git status --short
test -f docs/seo/CANONICAL_URL_PATTERN_STRATEGY.md && test -f docs/seo/SEO_ROUTE_CONTRACT.md && echo "SEO-C docs exist"
pnpm env:check
pnpm db:validate:migrations
pnpm test:db:rls
pnpm routes:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

No validation command may be faked or skipped silently. `pnpm lint` may show warnings only, but must have no errors.

## 13. Out-of-Scope Items

SEO-C does not authorize:

- route creation
- migrations
- API handlers
- UI components
- business logic
- Supabase generated type changes
- validators
- route check changes
- RLS test changes
- SEO check changes
- seed rows
- keyword database imports
- article routes
- public SEO pages
- CMS records
- schema output
- sitemap changes
- robots changes
- `llms.txt` changes
- analytics events
- crawlers
- background jobs
- AI chat
- provider pages
- branded hospital pages
- programmatic pages
- payment gateways
- provider dashboards
- admin mutation/status/update workflows
- hidden AI-only content

## 14. Stop Conditions

Stop rather than guessing if any of these occur:

- route ambiguity
- route-contract conflict
- unsupported locale/country uncertainty
- doctor detail route conflict
- sitemap eligibility ambiguity
- canonical/hreflang ambiguity
- schema ambiguity
- medical content risk
- branded-search risk
- RLS/security ambiguity
- private-data exposure concern
- missing dependency
- failed command
- unclear requirement
- need to edit files outside the approved scope

The smallest safe response is to report the blocker, identify the conflicting file/rule/route, and request explicit human approval for the narrowest safe next step.
